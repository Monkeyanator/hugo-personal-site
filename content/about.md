My name is Sam and I like working on hard problems. Computers pose some interesting ones and solve a few others, but really, there are hard problems everywhere.

I'm currently a Staff Software Engineer at [Aviatrix Systems](https://aviatrix.com/). Before that I worked on [Istio stuff](https://istio.io) at Google, where I served as an Environments Working Group Lead, Upgrade Working Group Lead, and release manager for 1.10 and 1.15.

Before that I interned at Google Cloud a couple of times, once on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), where I [made this](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/mutating-trace-admission-controller), and afterwards on Istio security features. I also worked as an intern on trading technologies at [Belvedere Trading](http://www.belvederetrading.com/) and ad tech at [Amino Payments](https://www.aminopay.com/).

I studied Computer Science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/computer-science/), where I researched at the [DTR Lab](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/). Before that, I worked at the [Knowledge Discovery and Web Mining Lab](http://webmining.spd.louisville.edu/) [under this research grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1549981).
