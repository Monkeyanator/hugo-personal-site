Cursed beneath a Southern star    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disgraced there, Norris, a Spring eve-        
Kasbah. The Kashbah Room. Breathless,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made naked there, then.    
    
And time faltered in the Kasbah Room     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pool rackets deadened    
Rock-em-sock-em fuck-its    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boxed and tucked off.    
    
All silent in the Kasbah Room!
