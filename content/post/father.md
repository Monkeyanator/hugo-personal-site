You had been four years in Paradise when I last saw you.      
Next to me in a restaurant    
Occupied with your phone per usual.     

You’d forgotten the English you once knew    
And couldn’t seem to meet my eyes    

As you cannot throw a log onto a dying fire    
I couldn’t leap to hug you    
Or bend to cry on your shirt    

So I reached over and paused what you were watching    
(Recitations of The Scripture),    
Took your glasses off    

And we sat fixed in downward gazes    
Loving one another in silence    
Until I in waking rendered you back to Paradise.
