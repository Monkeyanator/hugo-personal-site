Your whiskers were grey    
As long as I knew you-    
You came to us from another world I think   
Already ancient and wise    
In your movement    

(You understood us   
So much better than we understood you.)   

Olive!     
Our little teapot   
Our little steward  

You remind me how different two things can be   
And still love each other.    

You waddled up to us    
In our lowest moments   
And if you got heavier over time    
It was only because your fur    
Became so heavy with our tears   

I hope that we scratched your belly enough  
And I hope that you knew your own name because  
You had a gentle, poised one    
That suited you well.
